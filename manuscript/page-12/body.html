When she sews, she does not take long stitches, nor pucker her work; but does it very neatly, just as her mother tells her to do. And she always keeps her work very clean; for if her hands are dirty, she washes them before she begins her work: and when  she has finished it, she folds it up, and puts it by very carefully, in her work-bag, or in a drawer. It is very seldom indeed that she loses her thread, or needles, or any thing she has to work with. She does not stick needles on her sleeve, nor put pins in her mouth; for she has been told these are silly,  dangerous tricks; and she always pays attention to what is said to her.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">She takes care of her own clothes, and folds them up very neatly.
