She is never noisy nor troublesome; so they like to have her with them, and they like to talk to her, and to instruct her.</p><p>She has learned to read so well, and she is so good a girl, that her father has given her several  new books, which she reads in by herself, whenever she likes; and she understands all that is in them.</p><p><a href="images/0006m.jpg">0006m </a></p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
